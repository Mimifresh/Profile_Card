                    <h3>Confidence Level</h3>
                    <P>I won't say i am super confident that my current skills level will do justice to all the tasks in this Internship.
                        I am yet to master NextJS framework and other advanced Javascript concepts, that is why i am here in the first place,
                        eager to learn and improve my skills throughout the program. I believe with Grit and hardwork,
                        I can research, breakdown task into paths and solve the problem.
